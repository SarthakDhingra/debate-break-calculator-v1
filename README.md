### HOW TO RUN PROGRAM
- make sure you have python3 and virtualenv installed
- run 'setup.sh' in the root folder
- run 'flask run' in the root folder
- when you're done run 'deactivate' to close the virtual environment

### TO DO
- Handle Edge Cases
    - No Guranteed Break
    - Only one round (already done I think)
- Fix form resubmission error (should probably use post --> redirect --> get pattern)
